# HEPATITIS DISEASES PREDICTION WITH PYCARET

### A LITTLE ABOUT THIS PROJECT

This project is for `hepatitis` prediction based-off of the constituting blood features. 

The model used in this model for the classification is the Random Forest which is the model that
has the best performance amongst other models tested on this dataset.

It should be known that Hepatitis is a dangerous disease that can affect anyone no matter the age group, and to this 
effect, utmost care should be taken in checking for symptoms and consulting the appropriate Physician.

For future work, more model tuning and optimization can be conducted to get even more performance out of this model. And 
more data can be brought in to further train and test the model.

Also, model deployment is another area we can focus on for future work.

Thank you for reading thus far and on to the next one.
